# Spiking-Neural-Networks

This project simulates a spiking neural network using the Brian 2 python library and
trains it on the MNIST Numbers and MNIST Fashion datasets. Spike-timing-dependent
plasticity (STDP) was used and the effect of of changing the network and STDP parameters, as well
as the differences between training on the Fashion and Numbers dataset investigated.
